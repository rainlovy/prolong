Life is a journey, full of twists and turns A rollercoaster ride that often churns It takes us to places we’ve never been A journey of discovery, like nothing we’ve seen

Life is a challenge, a test of our will It can be tough, but we must fulfill Our dreams and aspirations, with courage and skill We must push forward, and never stand still

Life is a gift, to be cherished each day A precious jewel that never fades away We must make the most of every moment, come what may And live our lives to the fullest, every single day
